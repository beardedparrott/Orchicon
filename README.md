# Orchicon

AI orchestration and operations platform that coordinates autonomous AI
work as reliable, observable, recoverable, and manageable systems.

Orchicon separates **orchestration** from **execution**: it manages
projects, workers, scheduling, policies, telemetry, recovery, and
governance, while pluggable runtimes execute the work.

> Orchicon orchestrates. Runtimes execute.

## Documentation

The comprehensive project documentation lives in
[`DOCUMENTATION.md`](./DOCUMENTATION.md) at the project root. It
covers architecture, project structure, installation, development,
deployment, troubleshooting, and every subsystem.

## Technology Stack

- **Control plane**: Go (single binary, k8s-style reconcilers)
- **Single container**: `orchicon container` runs the whole stack (Postgres, NATS, Tempo/Loki/VictoriaMetrics/Grafana, control plane) as PID 1 — see [DOCUMENTATION.md §Single-Container Deployment](DOCUMENTATION.md)
- **API**: Protobuf + Connect (gRPC + REST + streaming from one schema)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with RLS + transactional outbox
- **Event bus**: NATS JetStream
- **Telemetry**: OpenTelemetry → Grafana stack (Tempo + Loki + VictoriaMetrics) — fully separated infra
- **Policy**: Rego (Open Policy Agent)
- **Runtime adapters**: pluggable gRPC sidecars — a **built-in native engine runs by default and needs nothing installed**, plus external adapters such as OpenCode. Adapters are optional and never bundled.
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React + Vite + Connect-ES

## Last Release Changes

- **OpenCode is optional**: Orchicon no longer requires an external runtime CLI: its own native engine runs sessions inside the control plane, and the OpenCode serve is started **only when something actually needs it**.
- **A complete terminal client**: `orch` is no longer a launcher alongside the GUI: it is a full client, with read *and* write parity across **all seven domains**.
- **Work is workflow-first**: Every run is now a workflow: standalone dispatch is retired, so a work item with no bound workflow cannot be scheduled, and the platform tells you when you create it rather than failing later at run time.
- **Ask Orchicon**: Its three modes are now enforced by the **platform**, not requested in prose: the tools a mode may not use are withheld from it and refused at the point of execution, so "Brainstorm will not write your files" is a refusal a model cannot talk its way past — and the boundary is adapter-agnostic, so a new runtime inherits it.
- **Runs execute in containers, and the plane heals itself**: Worker executions run in an isolated container per workflow run, drawn from a warm pool so dispatch never cold-starts, and reset between runs so no state crosses a boundary.
- **Quick Work hands off end to end**: The dispatch mode whose whole purpose is to hand work over now actually does it: it asks the model question, confirms git, and publishes the workflow and work item so a run fires — with the DevOps step opening and merging the pull request.
- OpenCode is now **optional everywhere**: the installer no longer warns that a runtime CLI is missing, and the docs describe adapters as pluggable rather than required.
- **Scheduler and dispatch**: cancel and abort genuinely stop the model session; recovery survives DAG pass limits; PR-merge loops and orphaned branch references fixed; tool-wedge recovery no longer kills a live turn; a tool-hang is redirected instead of orphaning the worker.
- **Ask Orchicon sessions**: follow-ups resolve against the *execution's* adapter rather than the host; tool-call replay no longer 400s after a model switch; attachments deliver; the phantom "budget" workers reported in Ask is gone.
- **Terminal client**: a key that produced a send could be silently swallowed; clicking now places the caret on wrapped and scrolled text; a stale shell reference stopped every notice (and half of every theme switch) from landing; lazy screen loads, scroll preservation and tab focus corrected.
- **Diff pipeline and telemetry**: the file-edit ledger no longer reports empty on live runs; diffs are server-computed; per-event invalidations are coalesced; the outbox is throttled with retention so a chatty run cannot flood the database.
- **Runtime images**: build from the terminal with live logs, and set them across a selection in bulk.

## Installation

### One-line install (Linux / macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash
```

The installer downloads the binary, then runs `orchicon install` to set up everything: pull the published images, start the runtime daemon, launch the single-container instance, and print how to connect / start / stop. (Pass `--no-setup` to install only the binary.)

> **Adapters are optional — the native engine needs nothing installed.** Orchicon ships its own runtime engine and runs sessions inside the control plane, so a fresh install is complete on its own: no adapter CLI, no binary probe, no serve. Install an external adapter (OpenCode, and future ones like Claude Code / Codex) only if you want to run work on that runtime. Orchicon **never bundles or ships** an adapter CLI — your own host install is bind-mounted into the containers at runtime, which keeps the product redistributable regardless of an adapter's licence (Claude Code's terms prohibit bundling).
>
> To use OpenCode as a runtime:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
> ```
>
> `orchicon install` no longer requires it. A plane whose model refs need no adapter never probes for the binary, never starts a serve, and never mounts it into a container — see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md).

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell) — runs the stack inside WSL2
irm https://orchicon.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Single container (Docker)

The whole Orchicon stack (Postgres, NATS, Tempo/Loki/VictoriaMetrics/Grafana, control plane) runs in one container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 3002:3000 -v orchicon-data:/var/lib/orchicon ghcr.io/beardedparrott/orchicon
```

The `orchicon` binary is the PID-1 supervisor (`orchicon container`). See [DOCUMENTATION.md §Single-Container Deployment](DOCUMENTATION.md) for the lifecycle script, env vars, and data-preservation notes.

### Windows (WSL2)

```powershell
irm https://orchicon.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

Orchicon's runtime layer (runtime daemon, unix socket, container mounts) is POSIX-only, so on Windows the **whole stack runs inside WSL2**. The installer provisions/detects WSL2, installs the **Linux** binary inside the distro, and runs the one-command setup there. WSL2 forwards `localhost`, so the UIs open from Windows at the same URLs as on Linux: `http://localhost:8080` (control plane) and `http://localhost:3002` (Grafana).

Prerequisites:
- **Windows 10 21H2+ / Windows 11**, with WSL2 and a Linux distro (first-time users: run `wsl --install` in an admin shell, then reboot — the installer will guide you).
- **Docker Desktop** with WSL2 integration enabled for your distro (or Docker Engine installed inside it).

Project directories are entered in the UI as their **WSL path** — a Windows project `C:\Users\you\projects\Foo` is `/mnt/c/Users/you/projects/Foo` inside WSL. See [DOCUMENTATION.md §Installation Guide](DOCUMENTATION.md) for details.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--version <tag>` | Install a specific version (e.g. `v0.3.0`). Default: latest. |
| `--install-dir <dir>` | Installation directory (default: `~/.local/bin`). On Windows this is a **WSL path** (the binary installs inside the distro). |
| `--no-setup` | Install the binary only — do not pull images / start the runtime daemon / launch the container. |
| `--uninstall` | Remove Orchicon from the install directory. |
| `--dry-run` | Print what would happen without making changes. |
| `--clean` | Stop dev containers, remove old binary, then install latest. All user data preserved. |
| `--force-clean` / `--nuke` | Wipe everything: destroy Docker volumes, remove blob store data and runtime state, then install latest. **All data lost.** |

```bash
# Install a specific version
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --version v0.3.0

# Uninstall
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --uninstall

# Clean upgrade (preserves data)
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --clean

# Force clean and reinstall (destroys all data)
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --force-clean
```

After installation, verify with `orchicon version`. The full stack runs
as a single container — see [Single container](#single-container-docker)
and [DOCUMENTATION.md §Single-Container Deployment](DOCUMENTATION.md).

> **Note:** Pre-built binaries are published to [GitHub
> Releases](https://github.com/beardedparrott/Orchicon/releases). If no
> releases exist yet (pre-v1), build from source instead:

### What gets installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beardedparrott/Orchicon.git
cd Orchicon
make build          # → bin/orchicon
make dev-start      # full dev environment
```

## Development

The control plane is Go; the frontend is TypeScript + Vite. All common
tasks are in the `Makefile` (`make help`).

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Node 22+
- Docker (the single-container deployment needs only Docker)
- [`buf`](https://buf.build) and [`atlas`](https://atlasgo.io) — install
  with `make tools`

### Quick start

```bash
make container-build          # build bin/orchicon + the container image
make container-up             # start the dev instance on :8080 (:3002 Grafana)
# or: scripts/container.sh up dev
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz   # {"status":"ok"}
```

Frontend development against a running instance: `make fe-install` (first
time) then `make fe-dev` — the Vite dev server on :5173 proxies the API to
:8080. Migrations run automatically on container boot (embedded runner).

### Authentication

The control plane authenticates every RPC. In local mode
(`ORCHICON_OIDC_ISSUER=local`) a built-in dev identity provider mints
short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens with no external IdP — the
full auth flow is verifiable locally. Production sets a real OIDC
issuer (`ORCHICON_MODE=production` enforces this on boot). The frontend
login page (`/login`) offers both the dev IdP and OIDC SSO. See
`.env.example` for the auth config variables.

### Codegen

The Protobuf schema (`proto/`) is the single source of truth. One
schema generates the Go (connect-go) and TypeScript (Connect-ES)
clients:

```bash
make gen          # buf generate → api/gen/go + frontend/src/api/gen
```

Generated code is committed (see DOCUMENTATION.md §Code Generation).

### Layout

| Path | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCUMENTATION.md` | Comprehensive project documentation |
| `cmd/orchicon/` | Control-plane binary entry point + `dev` subcommand |
| `internal/` | api, auth, config, db, domain, eventbus, outbox, reconciler, server, telemetry, migrate, middleware, rbac, tenant, blobstore, webhook, version |
| `assets.go` | go:embed directives for container configs, migrations, frontend |
| `proto/` | Protobuf schema (`orchicon.api.v1`, `orchicon.adapter.v1`) |
| `api/gen/` | Generated Go code |
| `db/` | Atlas declarative schema + versioned migrations |
| `deploy/container/` | Single-container image (Dockerfile + embedded runtime configs) |
| `frontend/` | Vite + React + Connect-ES + TanStack Router + shadcn/ui |
| `site/` | Static landing page (`orchicon.dev`) |
| `scripts/` | Installers, CI gates, dev controller |

### CI gate

```bash
make ci          # buf lint + codegen + go vet/test + RLS gate
```

The RLS gate (see DOCUMENTATION.md §Key Architecture Invariants) fails if any `tenant_id`-bearing table
lacks the `tenant_isolation` policy.
