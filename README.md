# Orchicon

AI orchestration and operations platform that coordinates autonomous AI
work as reliable, observable, recoverable, and manageable systems.

Orchicon separates **orchestration** from **execution**: it manages
projects, workers, scheduling, policies, telemetry, recovery, and
governance, while pluggable runtimes execute the work.

> Orchicon orchestrates. Runtimes execute.

## Documentation

The comprehensive project documentation lives in
[`DOCUMENTATION.md`](./DOCUMENTATION.md) at the project root. It
covers architecture, project structure, installation, development,
deployment, troubleshooting, and every subsystem.

## Technology Stack

- **Control plane**: Go (single binary, k8s-style reconcilers)
- **Single container**: `orchicon container` runs the whole stack (Postgres, NATS, Tempo/Loki/VictoriaMetrics/Grafana, control plane) as PID 1 — see [DOCUMENTATION.md §Single-Container Deployment](DOCUMENTATION.md)
- **API**: Protobuf + Connect (gRPC + REST + streaming from one schema)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with RLS + transactional outbox
- **Event bus**: NATS JetStream
- **Telemetry**: OpenTelemetry → Grafana stack (Tempo + Loki + VictoriaMetrics) — fully separated infra
- **Policy**: Rego (Open Policy Agent)
- **Runtime adapters**: gRPC sidecars (OpenCode first)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React + Vite + Connect-ES

## Last Release Changes

### v0.1.216 (2026-08-08)

| Type | Change |
|---|---|
| Feature | **Directories can be used as worker context, and work items get their own context files.** `projects.context_files` and the new `work_items.context_files` accept absolute file **or directory** paths. In the worker's composite prompt a directory is expanded into a bounded listing (up to 1000 entries, skipping VCS/build noise) with an explicit instruction to read every file and NOT open the directory path as a file (kills the "not a file" error); files stay inlined (now capped at 256 KiB with a truncation note). One shared renderer + validator (`internal/contextfiles`) serves both entities so they behave identically. Work items carry their own `context_files` (proto `WorkItem.context_files = 26`, create field 16, update field 22 with empty-list-clears semantics) with a FileBrowser card on the new/edit pages and read-only listing on the detail page — wired into the composite prompt as a `# Work item context` section on both workflow and standalone dispatch. Context paths are also mounted into the single-container instance (mount manifest unions work-item `context_files`) and per-workflow runtime containers (individual paths outside `project_dir`). Ask Orchicon / MCP `create_work_item`/`update_work_item` expose the same field. |
| Feature | **Work items get an Acceptance Review field.** A new first-class, human-readable `acceptance_review` column (migration `20260808120000_work_items_acceptance_review.sql`, proto `WorkItem.acceptance_review = 27`, update field 23) mirrors `acceptance_criteria`. When a bound workflow run reaches a terminal state, the `WorkflowReconciler` writes a deterministic markdown review in the same transaction as the status flip: "What was delivered" lists each succeeded step's worker `_summary` (with `_decision`), a failed run adds "Not delivered / needs attention" drawn from failed steps' `_issues`/`_summary`, and recovery episodes appear under "Recovery" — the same step data the `_run_narrative` JSON already aggregates (no LLM call on the reconciler hot path). The field is bounded (1 MiB), editable by humans via `UpdateWorkItem` (so reviewers can correct/extend), empty until a run completes, and exposed through the Ask Orchicon / MCP `update_work_item` tool plus the work item detail page (view + edit + YAML). Tests: `ValidateAcceptanceReview`, pure `formatAcceptanceReview` (completed/failed/recovery/empty), MCP update round-trip. |

### v0.1.215 (2026-08-08)

| Type | Change |
|---|---|
| Bug fix | **Cost explorer "By Workflow" breakdown now shows the work item name.** Each workflow run breakdown under Telemetry → Cost → By Workflow displays the bound work item's title as the primary run label instead of the raw run ID; the run ID is demoted to a muted secondary. One-shot runs with no bound ticket fall back cleanly to the run ID. Server-side, `GetWorkflowRunCosts` LEFT JOINs `work_items` on `workflow_runs.work_item_id` so `WorkflowRunCost` carries `work_item_id` + `work_item_name` (proto fields 7/8, regenerated Go + TS clients). |

## Installation

### One-line install (Linux / macOS)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash
```

The installer downloads the binary, then runs `orchicon install` to set up everything: pull the published images, start the runtime daemon, launch the single-container instance, and print how to connect / start / stop. (Pass `--no-setup` to install only the binary.)

> **Runtime adapter CLI required on the host (installed by you, never shipped).** Orchicon does **not** bundle opencode (or any future adapter CLI like Claude Code / Codex) in its images — the operator installs it on the host and it is bind-mounted into the containers at runtime. This keeps the product redistributable regardless of an adapter's license (Claude Code's terms prohibit bundling). Install opencode first:
>
> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
> ```
>
> `orchicon install` verifies it's present and fails with a clear message otherwise.

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell) — runs the stack inside WSL2
irm https://orchicon.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Single container (Docker)

The whole Orchicon stack (Postgres, NATS, Tempo/Loki/VictoriaMetrics/Grafana, control plane) runs in one container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 3002:3000 -v orchicon-data:/var/lib/orchicon ghcr.io/beardedparrott/orchicon
```

The `orchicon` binary is the PID-1 supervisor (`orchicon container`). See [DOCUMENTATION.md §Single-Container Deployment](DOCUMENTATION.md) for the lifecycle script, env vars, and data-preservation notes.

### Windows (WSL2)

```powershell
irm https://orchicon.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

Orchicon's runtime layer (runtime daemon, unix socket, container mounts) is POSIX-only, so on Windows the **whole stack runs inside WSL2**. The installer provisions/detects WSL2, installs the **Linux** binary inside the distro, and runs the one-command setup there. WSL2 forwards `localhost`, so the UIs open from Windows at the same URLs as on Linux: `http://localhost:8080` (control plane) and `http://localhost:3002` (Grafana).

Prerequisites:
- **Windows 10 21H2+ / Windows 11**, with WSL2 and a Linux distro (first-time users: run `wsl --install` in an admin shell, then reboot — the installer will guide you).
- **Docker Desktop** with WSL2 integration enabled for your distro (or Docker Engine installed inside it).

Project directories are entered in the UI as their **WSL path** — a Windows project `C:\Users\you\projects\Foo` is `/mnt/c/Users/you/projects/Foo` inside WSL. See [DOCUMENTATION.md §Installation Guide](DOCUMENTATION.md) for details.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--version <tag>` | Install a specific version (e.g. `v0.2.0`). Default: latest. |
| `--install-dir <dir>` | Installation directory (default: `~/.local/bin`). On Windows this is a **WSL path** (the binary installs inside the distro). |
| `--no-setup` | Install the binary only — do not pull images / start the runtime daemon / launch the container. |
| `--uninstall` | Remove Orchicon from the install directory. |
| `--dry-run` | Print what would happen without making changes. |
| `--clean` | Stop dev containers, remove old binary, then install latest. All user data preserved. |
| `--force-clean` / `--nuke` | Wipe everything: destroy Docker volumes, remove blob store data and runtime state, then install latest. **All data lost.** |

```bash
# Install a specific version
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --version v0.2.0

# Uninstall
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --uninstall

# Clean upgrade (preserves data)
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --clean

# Force clean and reinstall (destroys all data)
curl -fsSL https://orchicon.dev/install | bash -s -- --force-clean
```

After installation, verify with `orchicon version`. The full stack runs
as a single container — see [Single container](#single-container-docker)
and [DOCUMENTATION.md §Single-Container Deployment](DOCUMENTATION.md).

> **Note:** Pre-built binaries are published to [GitHub
> Releases](https://github.com/beardedparrott/Orchicon/releases). If no
> releases exist yet (pre-v1), build from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beardedparrott/Orchicon.git
cd Orchicon
make build          # → bin/orchicon
make dev-start      # full dev environment
```

## Development

The control plane is Go; the frontend is TypeScript + Vite. All common
tasks are in the `Makefile` (`make help`).

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Node 22+
- Docker (the single-container deployment needs only Docker)
- [`buf`](https://buf.build) and [`atlas`](https://atlasgo.io) — install
  with `make tools`

### Quick start

```bash
make container-build          # build bin/orchicon + the container image
make container-up             # start the dev instance on :8080 (:3002 Grafana)
# or: scripts/container.sh up dev
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz   # {"status":"ok"}
```

Frontend development against a running instance: `make fe-install` (first
time) then `make fe-dev` — the Vite dev server on :5173 proxies the API to
:8080. Migrations run automatically on container boot (embedded runner).

### Authentication

The control plane authenticates every RPC. In local mode
(`ORCHICON_OIDC_ISSUER=local`) a built-in dev identity provider mints
short-lived access tokens + refresh tokens with no external IdP — the
full auth flow is verifiable locally. Production sets a real OIDC
issuer (`ORCHICON_MODE=production` enforces this on boot). The frontend
login page (`/login`) offers both the dev IdP and OIDC SSO. See
`.env.example` for the auth config variables.

### Codegen

The Protobuf schema (`proto/`) is the single source of truth. One
schema generates the Go (connect-go) and TypeScript (Connect-ES)
clients:

```bash
make gen          # buf generate → api/gen/go + frontend/src/api/gen
```

Generated code is committed (see DOCUMENTATION.md §Code Generation).

### Layout

| Path | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| `DOCUMENTATION.md` | Comprehensive project documentation |
| `cmd/orchicon/` | Control-plane binary entry point + `dev` subcommand |
| `internal/` | api, auth, config, db, domain, eventbus, outbox, reconciler, server, telemetry, migrate, middleware, rbac, tenant, blobstore, webhook, version |
| `assets.go` | go:embed directives for container configs, migrations, frontend |
| `proto/` | Protobuf schema (`orchicon.api.v1`, `orchicon.adapter.v1`) |
| `api/gen/` | Generated Go code |
| `db/` | Atlas declarative schema + versioned migrations |
| `deploy/container/` | Single-container image (Dockerfile + embedded runtime configs) |
| `frontend/` | Vite + React + Connect-ES + TanStack Router + shadcn/ui |
| `site/` | Static landing page (`orchicon.dev`) |
| `scripts/` | Installers, CI gates, dev controller |

### CI gate

```bash
make ci          # buf lint + codegen + go vet/test + RLS gate
```

The RLS gate (see DOCUMENTATION.md §Key Architecture Invariants) fails if any `tenant_id`-bearing table
lacks the `tenant_isolation` policy.
